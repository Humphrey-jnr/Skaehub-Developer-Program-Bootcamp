## Number guessing game
### Description

A CLI app that generates a random number from a range of values
that is specified on user input. The user must guess the number after a hint from your
app. 
Every time a userâ€™s guess is wrong they should be prompted with more hints to
make it easier for them to guess the number but at the cost of reducing the score.

The program also has functions to check if an actual number is entered by the user
or not, to compare the input number with the actual number, to find the difference
between the two numbers.
When the user makes the correct guess, it automatically sends the user an SMS or
WhatsApp message with their final score.
